# Logic that validates integer input

Before the iteration block: The solution uses a Console.WriteLine() statement to prompt the user for an integer value between 5 and 10.<br>
Inside the iteration block:<br>
The logic uses a nullable string type and a Console.ReadLine() statement to obtain input from the user.<br>
The Logic the int.TryParse(a, out b) Method to convert string to integer <br>
If the integer value isn't between 5 and 10, A Console.WriteLine() statement is used to prompt the user for an integer value between 5 and 10.<br>
The Logic ensures that the integer value is between 5 and 10 before exiting the iteration.
